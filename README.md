InMotion is a program that helps you keep track of your emotional status. It adopts Face-api, which allows InMotion to analyze the stories buried underneath your facial expressions. Through the webcam, in each frame InMotion captures and discovers the ratio of seven emotional categories: happy, neutral, surprised, sad, angry, disgusted, and fearful, respectively. The data is visualized by presenting the composition of your emotion in real-time two-dimensional diagram. By moving the cursor around, you can readily take an insight into your emotion at any moment.
